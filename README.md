# Brosencephalon Anki Deck

In July 2014, reddit user Brosencephalon <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/2b8oia/my_fa2014_path_pharm_fapp_anki_deck/">posted an Anki deck</a> he made based on First Aid 2014 and Pathoma. The cards follow the <a href="https://www.supermemo.com/en/articles/20rules">twenty rules of formulating knowledge</a> (i.e., one fact per card). The deck has been fairly well vetted through several rounds of errata to remove errors and lower quality cards (see <a href="https://github.com/enlightenedchampagne/Brosencephalon/blob/master/README.md#errata">Errata</a>).

Anki is a flashcard application that uses a spaced repetition algorithm to generate the most efficient study schedule for you. Cards that you know will be seen less frequently and cards you get wrong often will come up more often. Anki is free for all computers and Android; the iOS app costs $25. Decks can be synced acrossed devices.
