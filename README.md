# Brosencephalon Anki Deck

In July 2014, reddit user Brosencephalon <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/2b8oia/my_fa2014_path_pharm_fapp_anki_deck/">posted an Anki deck</a> he made based on First Aid 2013 and Pathoma. The cards follow the <a href="https://www.supermemo.com/en/articles/20rules">twenty rules of formulating knowledge</a>. The deck has been fairly well vetted and been through several rounds of errata to remove errors and lower quality cards (see <a href="https://github.com/enlightenedchampagne/Brosencephalon/wiki/Errata">Errata</a>).

Anki is a flashcard application that uses spaced repetition and an algorithm to generate the most efficient study plan for you. To summarize, cards that you are really good at won't be seen for a while, and cards you get wrong often will come up way more often. The Anki app itself is free for all computers. There is an Android app (free) and an iOS app costs $25. If you have the app on different devices, you can "sync" your account and do flashcards in different locations.

<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4031794/">Research</a> has shown spaced repetition to be a practical learning strategy to learn effectively and optimize long-term retention of factual knowledge.
